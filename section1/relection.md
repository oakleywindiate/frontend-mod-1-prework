## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

What resonated with me the most about the article is that it emphasized our control over our potential and success in life. I try to be kind to myself and trust the learning process, and as I've gotten older taking "care of my brain" by eating correctly and exercising has gotten a lot easier. I struggle with reading. I used to read a lot as a child, but I never make time for it now even though I know I should. Also, I like the idea of taking short breaks and I've been implementing it lately while doing homework. It's been an amazing tactic so far and I wish I had utilized it earlier.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

I learned about three date types. String data types contain text and are usually used for names and sentences. Number data types are used to express a numerical value. Lastly, Boolean data types work by assigning variables the value "true or false".

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Characters used in code comments are "//" as well as "/* */". Comments allow the programmer to add information to the code for other developers to read. It isn't a functional part of the code and instead acts as a device to communicate messages with yourself or others who may read it. Comments can also keep the computer from running certain lines of code when testing.  

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable holds value. So, it's like a box that you can put whatever you want into and it will hold the item. We can put a toy dinosaur in our box and then label that box "toy box" so we can remember what's in it. Whenever we need the toy dinosaur we can grab the box from the shelf. If we ever want to change what's inside the box we can take the toy dinosaur out and put a different kind of toy in there instead, like a horse or doll. So our toy box is the variable and the value it holds inside is our toy.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I use a site called Poshmark to sell clothes I want to get rid of. It most likely has variables like:
var price (numerical)
var listingTitle (string)
var sold (Boolean)

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is putting multiple strings, variables, or numbers together to create one line of code.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

I often use an app called AllTrails that has information about hiking trails gathered from user ratings. The app formulates a sentence about each trail telling you about the amount of traffic, difficulty, and total milage. This would require concatenation of multiple values.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

How do I make sure my work has been successfully pushed to GitHub?
