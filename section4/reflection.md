## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

+ I really enjoy this technique. In fact, forcing myself to take a break makes me want to get back to solving the problem once it's over. Plus, it keeps me from getting burned out.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

+ I found that I was keeping myself accountable to my intentions more than I usually would if I hadn't consciously set them.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

+ An object stores data just like an array does. The difference is that an object can store data in strings. Objects have collections of values called "properties" that are stored in key-value pairs.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  *An* **array** *would be sufficient because we're storing the names of students and nothing else.*

  * List of states and their capitals
  *This would be best as an* **object** *because the key-value pair here is the state and the capital and this requires multiple strings of information.*

  * List of things to pack for vacation
  *The best option here would be an* **array** *as this doesn't require multiple strings and just needs to log the items being packed for vacation.*

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  *This only requires one value, so an* **array** *would be best.*

  * List of student names and their cohort
   *Student names and their cohort are like a key-value pair so an* **object** *would be best here.*

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
   *An* **object** *would be better in this case because baking a cake requires a set of characteristics to be paired together (key and value) that make one entity called "cake".*

  * All my favorite restaurants
  *An* **array** *would work here because you only need to list the restaurant names and nothing else.*

5. In this section, we talked about a `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

+ When you sell a stock on the Fidelity app the app reflects back to the user the price that it was sold at, the amount of cash available for investments/withdraws, and the current value of your portfolio.

There would be keys like:
name: "Oakley",
totalHoldingsInDollars: 3000,
availableBalanceInDollars: 1507,
onOrdersInDollars: 18

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

+ I am still not sure how to get my classes to loop through different values every time the code block is ran.
