## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

+ I usually feel self-conscious when I ask questions, but I know it's an important part of the learning process. I tend to wait too long to ask questions in class and I sit and think about them instead of listening which makes me feel even more behind.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

+ It is uncomfortable, but I think it's important to feel that way. Since I've started Turing my Googling skills have gotten a lot better. I know that this will be a big part of my job once I'm done with the program so I like the practice. It also allows you to get creative and see how others would solve problems or how others define the problem you're looking at.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

+ A conditional statement is an "if" or "if else" statement that governs a block of code.
+ A daily life example would be, "If I get my homework done, I pass. If I don't get my homework done, I fail."
+ For web applications, passwords would be an "if else" conditional. If the user enters the password correctly then they can proceed, else if entered incorrectly it will run a different block of code that does not allow access.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

+ You can add multiple conditions by adding "if else" after the initial "if" statement. The program will then go through the lines of code until it finds an "if" statement that matches the value it's been told to look for.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

+ To check if two conditions are met you can use the "&&", known as "AND", operator. If you want to check if 1 of 2 conditions are met you can use the "||", known as "OR", operator.  

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

+ I'm still not certain about which equal sign I should use. I used the strictly equals sign (===) because that's what I was instructed to do. Also, why aren't the less than and equal to symbols also structured like the "strictly equal to" operator. Shouldn't they be ">==" instead of ">="?
