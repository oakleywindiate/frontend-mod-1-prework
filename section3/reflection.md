## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

+ Two points that resonated with me were: 1) seeking out challenges and 2) understanding that mistakes are essential. I need to push myself to grow and learn more and seeking out challenges will help me gain confidence in doing this. Making mistakes is normal, and I need to be more kind to myself when I make mistakes.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

+ I demonstrate a growth mindset with other people. For example, I don't mind when other people make mistakes. I always see it as a learning experience for everyone involved and I don't take it personally. When it comes to myself, I'm much harder on myself than others. When I make mistakes, it's difficult some times to forgive myself.

+ Personally, I've always avoided challenges that I thought I couldn't execute perfectly. I don't really take risks or participate in things that I don't think I'll be successful in. This has caused me to miss out on *a lot* of opportunities. This is not a healthy growth mindset.


3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

+ Developers probably use arrays on the app Shopify. They would have an array of all the sellers listings. Or of all the "liked" items in someones cart.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

+ Array methods allow you to remove, edit, and add elements to an array.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

+ A loop allows the computer to run a block of code over and over again until a specific condition stops the process. With arrays, the loop can check each individual element in the array and run the same block of code over it as many times as instructed. Without an array, a loop just functions as a way to use a block of code over and over again depending on the input event by the user.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

+ Loops are an easy way for us to do something over and over again. It's kind of like driving a toy car around a Hot Wheels track over and over again.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

+ Using the "for" function is a bit confusing... `for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)`

+ I understand each part of it, but I really have to think about it every time to really grasp what I'm doing.
